This directory contains programs that interact with Z3 in different way for the purpose of benchmarking. They all take as input a `.smt` file, and such files can be generated by running this branch's fork of Pirouette (e.g. `cabal test`).

More precisely, we measure the running time of the following programs:
- [`with-bindings-oneshot-from-c.c`](https://github.com/tweag/pirouette/blob/ccd6c75631329cf8e9760b5daee45d405c1a64df/stamps/with-bindings-oneshot-from-c.c) reads the input file and sends it to Z3 using its C API;
- [`with-bindings-from-c.c`](https://github.com/tweag/pirouette/blob/ccd6c75631329cf8e9760b5daee45d405c1a64df/stamps/with-bindings-from-c.c) does the same thing except it reads and sends the input file line by line;
- [`with-bindings-bytestring-from-haskell.hs`](https://github.com/tweag/pirouette/blob/ccd6c75631329cf8e9760b5daee45d405c1a64df/stamps/with-bindings-bytestring-from-haskell.hs) reads the input file as bytestrings and sends it to Z3 line by line using its Haskell API;
- [`with-bindings-from-haskell.hs`](https://github.com/tweag/pirouette/blob/ccd6c75631329cf8e9760b5daee45d405c1a64df/stamps/with-bindings-from-haskell.hs) does the same thing except the input file is read and sent as high-level Haskell strings;
- [`with-shell-cmd-bytestring-from-haskell.hs`](https://github.com/tweag/pirouette/blob/ccd6c75631329cf8e9760b5daee45d405c1a64df/stamps/with-shell-cmd-bytestring-from-haskell.hs) launches Z3 as an external process in Haskell then reads the input file line by line as bytestrings and sends it to Z3 by writing on a channel;
- [`with-shell-cmd-from-haskell.hs`](https://github.com/tweag/pirouette/blob/ccd6c75631329cf8e9760b5daee45d405c1a64df/stamps/with-shell-cmd-from-haskell.hs) does the same thing except it reads and sends the input file as high-level Haskell strings.

These different programs can all be compiled using `make` and the benchmarks can be run using `make test`. This will generate a `results.md` file containing the results of the benchmark.
